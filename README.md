**Bulux Home Furnishings and Finishes Website**

This repository hosts the codebase for the Bulux Home Furnishings and Finishes company website. The website showcases furniture, paints, and home finishing products.

**Overview:**

Bulux is a platform designed to exhibit a range of furniture, paints, and home finishing products. The site primarily serves as a static application with the potential to implement dynamic functionality using a database system.

**Key Features:**

- Display of furniture, paints, and home finishing products.
- Static HTML pages comprising the application gallery.
- Potential for dynamic addition of images through a database integration.

**Preview:**

Explore the live preview of the website [here](https://bulux.vercel.app/).

**Note:** 
As of the current build, the application functions as a static website without database integration. However, future iterations may involve implementing a database to facilitate dynamic content updates, particularly within the application gallery.
